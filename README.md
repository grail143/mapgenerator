# Map Generator
 Generate a dungeon map for use in storytelling games such as DnD. Personalize the map to suit your needs. Download by right-click -> save.

## No prerequisites needed
 This generator is written in es6 javascript, css3, and html with no libraries or compilers, as per the original challenge. It is also a wip. 
 
## Current Functionality
 Generate a map by clicking 'New World'. Once a map is generated, you can click on any area to change what is there or add/remove sprites. Changes include choosing a different sprite, rotating or flipping a sprite, changing the sprite's size, or moving the sprite to a different location. 
 
## Shortcomings
 * The sprite sheets are currently limited, but more will be added later. 
 * There is functionality that has not been completely worked out or created at all, though there may be some evidence they exist. Like I said, it's a WIP!
 * Currently, all maps are rectangular based on a user chosen width and length. All the areas inside the rectangle are also rectangles based on user configured options. This may change in a future update for more interesting maps.
 * There is currently not a way to save and reload a map. So, like, don't accidentally choose a broken functionality that gets you stuck or reload the page if you've put a lot of work into it. Or, better yet. . . just wait until I'm done before you put too much effort into personalizing your maps. . . 
 
 ## Credits
  All sprites were taken from https://forgotten-adventures.net. Please go throw some money at their amazing creations. . . or don't. I'm not here to control you.
